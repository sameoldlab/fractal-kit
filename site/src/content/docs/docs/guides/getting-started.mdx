Fractl is a framework-agnostic UI library for interacting with blockchains, smart contracts, and wallets. Built for an ecosystem of fragmented ecosystems.

Fractl is an experiment to see how far we can push ecosystem-agnostic UIs, starting with a connect modal. Using applications across different chains and VMs, shouldn't have such jarring shifts in user experience. If you'd like to change that on your app follow the instructions below to get started.

## Setup

<Steps>
1. Install Fractl UI
	
	<Tabs>
		<TabItem label="pnpm">
			<Code code={"pnpm add fractl-ui"} lang="bash" />
		</TabItem>
		<TabItem label="npm">
			<Code code={"npm install fractl-ui"} lang="bash" />
		</TabItem>
		<TabItem label="yarn">
			<Code code={"yarn install fractl-ui"} lang="bash" />
		</TabItem>
	</Tabs>
	
2. Add a chain package for the appropriate network(s).

    <Tabs>
    	<TabItem label="EVMs">
    		```sh
    		pnpm add fractl-ui/evm wagmi viem
    		```
    	 </TabItem>
    	<TabItem label="Starknet">
    		```sh
    		pnpm add fractl-ui/starknet
    		```
    	</TabItem>
    	<TabItem label="Fuel">
    		```sh
    		pnpm add fractl-ui/fuel fuel
    		```
    	</TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Setup

   The general pattern stays the same across core packages. Refer to the specific documentation for more details. Using the evm as an example:

   ```html
   <body>
   	<fractl-modal />

   	<script>
   		/* import fractl-modal from @fractl-ui/ui. (Web Components do not need named imports) */
   		import 'fractl-ui'
   		import { addEvm } from '@fractl-ui/evm'
   		/* setup wagmi regularly */
   		import { wagmiConfig } from './lib/wagmiConfig'

   		/* addEvm returns an object. So we need to pass it to fractl-modal using javascript */
   		const connections = addEvm({config: wagmiConfig})
   		document.querySelector('fractl-modal')!.config = connections
   	</script>
   </body>
   ```

   Fractl manages it's state internally, passing updates to extenal libraries you already&nbsp;use.

</Steps>

## Can I use this now?

Fractl is still very early and some important features will require the API is going to change (for example, to use multiple networks together). That said, Fractl UI and Fractl EVM work relatively well as they are. You should stick to a fixed version if you do decide to use it.
